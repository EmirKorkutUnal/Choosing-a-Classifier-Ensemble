<h1>Choosing a Classifier Ensemble</h1>
This Python code is aimed to measure and compare Scikit-Learn Classifier Ensembles.
<h2>Background</h2>
There are many useful classification methods within <a href=https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>Scikit-Learn</a>, machine learning library for Python. In this article, we'll concentrate on <a href=https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.ensemble>ensemble methods</a> Ensemble models combine multiple models to create a better model and produce more accurate predictions.<br><br>
Remember that each dataset has its unique characteristics, meaning the results would vary depending on dataset.<br><br>
The aim of this code is to make things easy to decide which ensemble model should be selected. You can specify other classification methods (like Logistic Regression) or eliminate existing ones from the code to get your desired comparison; the code would be very similar as long as you use Scikit-Learn notation.
